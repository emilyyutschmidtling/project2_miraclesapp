# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# posts = Post.create([
#   {
#     content: "Post 1 - If you can see this message, it's a miracle!!!  And here's a cat picture for fun...",
#     photo_url: "http://i.imgur.com/EBWst9O.jpg"
